  #
  # To display the image on the client side the image might additionally get
  # resized to match container element, but the file sent to the server will
  # always be in camera's native resolution.
  #
  # By design the file sent to the server will only contain the area that was
  # visible to the user during capture. There is no way of sending unclipped,
  # full camera frame without showing the whole frame to the user.
  #
  # Resizing container after the camera has been initialized is not supported.
  #
  # Various options provided here can be overwritten when calling
  # {JpegCamera#capture capture} or {Snapshot#upload}.
  #
  # @param container [DOMElement, String] DOM element or element's ID.
  #
  # @option options swf_url [String] URL to the SWF file that should be used
  #   for fallback if HTML5 cannot be used. "/jpeg_camera/jpeg_camera.swf" by
  #   default.
  # @option options shutter_mp3_url [String] URL to the shutter mp3 sound file.
  #   Used by flash. "/jpeg_camera/shutter.mp3" by default.
  # @option options shutter_ogg_url [String] URL to the shutter ogg sound file.
  #   Used by HTML5. "/jpeg_camera/shutter.ogg" by default.
  # @option options on_ready [Function] Function to call when camera is ready.
  #   Inside the callback camera object can be accessed as `this`. This
  #   function will receive object with `video_width` and `video_height`
  #   properties as the first argument. These indicate camera's native
  #   resolution. See also {JpegCamera#ready}.
  # @option options on_error [Function] Function to call when camera error
  #   occurs. Error message will be passed as the first argument. Inside the
  #   callback camera object can be accessed as `this`. See also
  #   {JpegCamera#error}.
  # @option options on_debug [Function] This callback can be used to log various
  #   events and information that can be useful when debugging JpegCamera. Debug
  #   message will be passed as the first argument. Inside the callback camera
  #   object can be accessed as `this`. There is a default implementation of
  #   this callback that logs messages to window.console if available.
  # @option options quality [Float] Quality of the JPEG file that will be
  #   uploaded to the server. Should be between 0 and 1. 0.9 by default. Can be
  #   overwritten when calling {JpegCamera#capture capture}. _Cannot_ be
  #   overwritten at the time of upload.
  # @option options mirror [Boolean] The video stream and images displayed on
  #   the client side mimic a mirror, because that's how people are used to
  #   seeing themselves. By default images are uploaded to the server in their
  #   natural orientation - how the front facing camera sees the user.
  #   This option can be set to true to upload images the way the user sees
  #   them. Can be overwritten when calling {JpegCamera#capture capture}.
  #   _Cannot_ be overwritten at the time of upload.
  # @option options shutter [Boolean] Whether to play shutter sound when
  #   capturing snapshots. Can be overwritten when calling
  #   {JpegCamera#capture capture}.
  # @option options api_url [String] URL where the snapshots will be uploaded.
  #   Can be overwritten when calling {JpegCamera#capture capture} or
  #   {Snapshot#upload}.
  # @option options csrf_token [String] CSRF token to be sent in the
  #   __X-CSRF-Token__ header during upload. Can be overwritten when calling
  #   {JpegCamera#capture capture} or {Snapshot#upload}.
  # @option options timeout [Integer] __IGNORED__ (__NOT__ __IMPLEMENTED__)
  #   The number of milliseconds a request can take before automatically being
  #   terminated. Default of 0 means there is no timeout. Can be overwritten
  #   when calling {JpegCamera#capture capture} or {Snapshot#upload}.
  # @option options on_upload_done [Function] Function to call when upload
  #   completes. Snapshot object will be available as `this`, response body will
  #   be passed as the first argument. Can be overwritten when calling
  #   {JpegCamera#capture capture} or {Snapshot#upload}.
  # @option options on_upload_fail [Function] Function to call when upload
  #   fails. Snapshot object will be available as `this`, response code will
  #   be passed as the first argument followed by error message and response
  #   body. Can be overwritten when calling {JpegCamera#capture capture} or
  #   {Snapshot#upload}.
  # @option options retry_if [Function] Function to be called before any upload
  #   done/fail callbacks to decide if the upload should be retried. By default
  #   it's null and uploads are never retried.
  #   Inside the function snapshot object will be available as `this` and the
  #   arguments will be: `status_code`, `error_message`, `response`, `retry`.
  #   `retry` is a number incremented for each retry and starting with 1 when
  #   the upload finishes for the first time.
  #   If the function returns `true` or `0` then upload will be retried
  #   immediately. Number greater than `0` will delay the retry by
  #   that many milliseconds. Any other value will be treated as a decision not
  #   to retry the upload and one of the `on_upload_done` or `on_upload_fail`
  #   callbacks will be fired instead.
  #   Can be overwritten when calling {JpegCamera#capture capture} or
  #   {Snapshot#upload}.
  # @option options retry_success [Boolean] By default `retry_if` is not called
  #   for uploads that finish with a status code from the 2XX range. Set this
  #   to `true` if you want to retry some of these responses. This can be
  #   useful if you're experiencing some network oddities. Can be overwritten
  #   when calling {JpegCamera#capture capture} or {Snapshot#upload}.
